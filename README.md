### What I learned

-Scaling of SVG backgrounds


Some CSS code I'm proud of

```css
.wrapper {
  max-width: 350px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-right: -50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
}

@media screen and (max-width: 800px) and (orientation: Landscape) {
  body {
    background-size: 125%;
    background-position: 270% 55%, -120% -30%;
  }
}

```


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on: CSS Flex, Grid, mobile first approach and React in future projects. These are concepts i am still not completely comfortable with or techniques i found useful that i want to refine and perfect.
